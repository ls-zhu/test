<mvidner> Hi! your other account disconnected right after I replied, so I repeat:
<mvidner> We now prefer Yast::Execute http://www.rubydoc.info/github/yast/yast-yast2/Yast/Execute (which is a wrapper for Cheetah http://www.rubydoc.info/github/openSUSE/cheetah/Cheetah.run )
<mvidner> The main advantage of Cheetah is avoiding using the shell, with its quoting and escaping traps

<mvidner> Lingshan's question is: can he use CWM::Dialog for a non-wizard popup?
<mvidner> I am not sure, CWM does seem to assume a Wizard, but it would be a shame if we could not use it elsewhere
<lszhu_> I need a pop up window that I can place labels / input fields / buttons. In the new CWM way, not old fashion code which your guys not recommended
<lszhu_> Maybe I should try UI/dialog again
<lslezak> jreidinger: ^^^ do we have something like UI/popup?
<jreidinger> mvidner: well, storage-ng uses that. I think that teclator or ancorgs knows details
<lszhu_> ping ancorgs teclator :)
<jilopez> mvidner: jreidinger: https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/src/lib/y2partitioner/dialogs/popup.rb
<lszhu_> oh, it's using CWM::Dialog, so it is not a full-size window?
<lslezak> jsrain: um, which bug number? I cannot find it...
<jsrain> lslezak: https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1059065
<ancorgs> lszhu_: on the other hand, I would only recomend CWM::Dialog if you are already using CWM for the rest of your interface, so you need the new dialog to be WITHIN your CWM infrastructure
<ancorgs> in other case, I would recoment UI::Dialog
<mvidner> lszhu_: the `layout` method emulates Wizard UI interface (the :contents id), and wizard_create_dialog overrides the big wizard
<lszhu_> ancorgs, thanks and that's why I stick to CWM. Do you mean CWM::Dialog can be a smaller size?
<lszhu_> mvidner, I don't understand so much CWM internals yet, do you mean if I also use layout like the code above, I can get a smaller window?
<lslezak> jsrain: should be hopefully easy (so out-of -scrum is OK)
<ancorgs> lszhu_: just copy and paste the wizard_create_dialog and should_open_dialog? methods from the example provided by jilopez
<jsrain> lslezak: thanks!
<ancorgs> and you will have a window of whatever size you decide
<lszhu_> ancorgs, thanks, I would try that code when I get office tomorrow!
<lszhu_> Let me record these in my nots
<ancorgs> and that size is decided by the methods #layouts and #contents
<lszhu_> Cool!!!!
<ancorgs> "layout" singular
<jilopez> lszhu_: here you have an example using the Popup class
<jilopez> lszhu_: https://github.com/yast/yast-storage-ng/blob/master/src/lib/y2partitioner/dialogs/btrfs_subvolumes.rb
<lszhu_> I am so moved to tears.. This problem troubled me for 2 weeks even I am having my vacations.. 
<imobach> please, anyone to review the blog post? https://lizards.opensuse.org/?p=12762&preview=true
* lslezak is now known as lslezak_
<imobach> ancorgs: mvidner: lslezak_: jreidinger: snwint: I am mainly looking at you :)
<lszhu_> Thanks for your kindly help, it is 21:30 in Beijing now, I am leaving for a shower
<lszhu_> Thanks and Bye!
<ancorgs> lszhu_: event #layout could not be needed at all
<lslezak_> imobach: yes, just after finishing the roles PR, already in the queue for some time... ;-)
<lszhu_> yes?
<lszhu_> I am still here
<lszhu_> but it seems layout is used to re-size the window
<ancorgs> maybe just doing "Yast::UI.OpenDialog(contents)" in the line 9 of that example
* lslezak_ is now known as lslezak
<imobach> lslezak_: sure, not in a hurry
<HuHa> lszhu_: yes, if you don't use a wizard dialog, the layout defines the window size
<lszhu_> Then how can Yast know which size should the window be?
<ancorgs> would be enough for you. If you don't have weird widgets like tables inside the window
<ancorgs> based on the content
<lszhu_> No, just labels or inputs
<HuHa> lszhu_: but you can easily enforce a special size by using a HSpacing in the VBox and a VSpacing in the HBox
<jreidinger> lslezak: one more https://github.com/yast/skelcd-control-leanos/pull/8 and SLED will follow
<HuHa> as a matter of fact, for everything that can scroll internally it makes very much sense to do that
<ancorgs> we enforced size and height with HSpacing and MinSize because the tables tend to misbehave with dinamically calculated windows
<HuHa> i.e. enforce a certain minimum size so the content of a list or tree remains visible
* HuHa wrote a documentation for that 10+ years ago
<lszhu_> Then maybe I just need a openDialog function, even not need a widget, I can try that
<ancorgs> lszhu_: so just try without enforcing the layout (use OpenDialog(contents) directly) and fallback to using the layout if it doesn't work for you
<ancorgs> the good old trial and error system
<HuHa> https://doc.opensuse.org/projects/YaST/SLES11/onefile/yast-onefile.html#initial_dialog_sizes
<lszhu_> I would try that
<lszhu_> HuHa, thanks for your doc
<HuHa> welcome
<HuHa> somewhere I used to have an OpenOffice presentation for the simple things, too
* HuHa looks
<HuHa> no, it's no longer there :-(
<lszhu_> Thanks, shower time for me now. Thanks and bye!
<HuHa> bye
